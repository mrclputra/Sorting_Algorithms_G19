# Sorting_Algorithms_G19
Data Structures Assignment

Changes were made in the linkedlist.h as merge sort is easier with an array \n
timer.h contains the timer functions, its called in the main.cpp as each sort does it thing (for now it doesnt show anything cuz i cant get the sorts to work) \n
main.cpp has been updated for the new functions (that i cant seem to make it work)
